The SRE Wheel of Misfortune : "Because shit will likely happen"

"Site Reliability Engineering" best pratices usualy recommends to organize "role playing" sessions to train the teams, to improve the processes+architectures and finaly it helps to shorten the time to resolution.<BR>
Such disaster can be pre-defined within the teams or randomly decided by "the fate" .<BR>
The SRE "Wheel of misfortune" will support the "pseudo random" approach by selecting failure from a pre-established <a href="https://github.com/mik0git/wheel-of-misfortune/blob/master/what-could-possibly-go-wrong">list</a>. <BR>
